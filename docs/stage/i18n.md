# Stage Plan: i18n End-to-End
**Focus**: `i18n`
**Status**: DRAFT (Scaffold)

## Context
- i18n must apply from landing language choice to dashboard + transactional emails.
- Default language selected at first entry should persist and be used everywhere.

## Goals
- Persist user locale (unauth + auth) and apply globally (UI + API + emails).
- Ensure email templates render in selected locale.
- Add fallback strategy and missing-key handling.
- Verification plan covering landing → wizard → delivery email.

## Non-Goals
- No redesign.
- No new languages beyond existing baseline (start with ES/EN unless repo differs).

## Checklist
- [ ] Define locale source-of-truth + persistence (cookie/localStorage/profile).
- [ ] Middleware / routing strategy for locale (App Router).
- [ ] Dashboard + wizard strings migrated to translation files.
- [ ] Emails: subject/body localized; locale passed to send pipeline.
- [ ] QA matrix (ES/EN) + build checks.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Drift between UI and emails → shared translation keys.
- Partial translations → fallback + logging.

## Verification Plan
- Fresh visitor selects ES → entire flow stays ES.
- Same user selects EN → persists after login/logout.
- Email sent in correct locale.
- `npm run build` passes.
